# Awesome Authentication & Authorization & SSO & IAM [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Quality Authentication & Authorization & SSO & IAM software and libraries.

[Authentication (aka AuthN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) and [authorization (aka AuthZ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization) are both security measures. Authentication is the process of verifying who you are. Authorization is the process of verifying that you have access to something. Authorization occurs after successful authentication.
